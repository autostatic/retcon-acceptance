# This config file is for more fine grained access control.

# There are some special macros defined for ports and ip adresses.
# port -> ftp and any (thats all ports!)
# ip -> any (yes, that's 0.0.0.0/0)


# The line format is like this:

## allow connections to port 80 from 85.158.200.66
# incoming!tcp!80!85.158.200.66
## allow udp connections to port 123 from 1.2.3.4/30
# incoming!udp!123!1.2.3.4/30
## allow ports 80 and 443 from 1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.5
# incoming!tcp!80,443!1.2.3.4,1.2.3.5

## Same things are possible for outgoing:
# outgoing!tcp!22!93.94.224.130

# Lines starting with a # will be ignored.

incoming!tcp!80,443!93.94.224.189,109.235.73.248
outgoing!tcp!9418!0.0.0.0/0
